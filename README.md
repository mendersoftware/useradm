## Getting started

To start using Mender, we recommend that you begin with the Getting started
section in [the Mender documentation](https://docs.mender.io/).


## Building from source

As the Mender server is designed as microservices architecture, it requires several
repositories to be built to be fully functional. If you are testing the Mender server it
is therefore easier to follow the getting started section above as it integrates these
services.

If you would like to build the User Administration service independently, you can follow
these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/mendersoftware/useradm.git
cd useradm
go build
```
